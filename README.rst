Configuration
#############

Before starting using ``distriploy``, you need to make sure that:

- The repository you'd like to make a release of has been cloned with ssh (not https);
- The repository contains a ``.distriploy.yml`` file in its root folder.

See `this repo's <.distriploy.yml>`_ for inspiration.

The file is YAML, it contains an object with the following members:

- ``release``: release information object
- ``release.method``: release method. Supported values are:

  - ``github``: the project has a github repo.

    Additional info may be provided if so:

    - ``release.remote``: string, optional (defaults to ``origin``)

      The local git repo remote corresponding to github.

    - ``postrelease.add_mirror_urls``: bool (defaults to ``false``)

      Whether to add to the release description a list of mirrors.
      Limited use because if github is down, the list is not
      accessible.

    - Environment variable ``GITHUB_TOKEN``, must be populated by user,
      contains a token string created from
      https://github.com/settings/tokens

      Set it up with eg.:

      Or add it to an environment file *not under revision control*.


- ``mirrors``: mirroring information object, containing members whose
  key is a mirror handle.

  Each entry contains:

  ``mirrors.${mirror}.method``: mirroring upload method. Supported
  values (unsupported are ignored, with a warning) are (TODO):

  - ``osf``: upload to https://osf.io

    Use requires installation with ``osf`` option, or subsequent
    installation of the ``osfclient`` dependency.

    Additional info may be provided if so:

    - ``project``: string, OSF project key

    - ``folder``: string, OSF file folder

    - ``name``: string, optional (defaults to release artifact name)

      Useful if using OSF's revision system.

    - Environment variables ``OSF_USERNAME`` and
      ``OSF_PASSWORD``.

      Set it up with eg.:

      .. code:: sh

         read OSF_USERNAME OSF_PASSWORD
         export OSF_USERNAME OSF_PASSWORD

      Or add it to an environment file *not under revision control*.


  - ``rsync``: upload with rsync

    Additional info may be provided if so:

    - ``remote``: string, rsync destination
    - ``public``: string, public URI prefix, accessible once upload is completed

  - ``academictorrents``: create torrent file, and upload to https://academictorrents.com

    The torrent file will be generated in cwd, named like the release
    artifact and added ``.torrent`` extension.


    Additional info may be provided if so:

    - ``params``: object, academictorrents upload params, to be POST'ed

    - Environment variables ``ACADEMICTORRENTS_USERNAME`` and
